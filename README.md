## Android Studio IDE Setup

For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be

## Dependencies

This project leverages several Jetpack Compose libraries to build a modern Android UI:

* **androidx.core:core-ktx:** Provides Kotlin extensions for core Android framework components.

* **androidx.viewpager2:viewpager2:** Offers an improved version of the ViewPager component,
  supporting both horizontal and vertical paging. It provides better performance and flexibility
  with dynamic content.

* **com.google.android.material:** Supplies a comprehensive set of Material Design components and
  styles, such as buttons, text fields, snackbars, and dialogs, to build visually appealing and
  consistent UIs.

* **androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:** Enables the creation of complex layouts with a
  flat view hierarchy by using constraint-based positioning. This layout manager helps reduce the
  need for nested view hierarchies, improving performance and making it easier to design responsive
  and adaptable UIs.
